TILDE|neutral|r|...Wait, what happened? It's a new chapter now?
SEISMIC|think|l|Yep. NEXTCHAPTER was called on 0.txt, so we're on 1.txt now. Each txt file is a different chapter.
TILDE|down|r|I didn't even notice it switching over.
SEISMIC|explain|l|Well, you can use one of these HEADER commands to announce it.
COMMAND|HEADER|CHAPTER NAME|THE CHAPTER OF CHAPTERS
SEISMIC|neutral|l|You can also use FADEOUT before NEXTCHAPTER to, you know, make it more natural.
TILDE|neutral|r|Is this gonna show up on the chapter select?
SEISMIC|explain|l|Yep, cuz the CHAPTERINFO command was called on this file.
TILDE|neutral|r|...Not to complain or nothin', but all this just looks like Summer.
SEISMIC|down|l|Well, you can replace whatever images and sounds you want with your own, as long as they got the same filename. You can also edit the style.css file.
SEISMIC|happy|l|Experiment with replacing assets and messing with the CSS rules! All the commands are listed on the GitHub page.
SEISMIC|happy|l|If you want an example of switching up the style, get rid of style.css and rename alternatestyleexample.css to style.css.
SEISMIC|neutral|l|That's enough for now, though. I'll just FADEALLLINES.
